## Distil the multidimensional information to dimensions where simple biologists can comprehend it

PCA is a very simple method that rotates your n-dimensional data (for instance expression data across many genes) such that the first dimension contains 
the largest spread (= variance) of the data, the second dimension contains the second-largest spread of the data, and so on.

1. Does the PCA changes drastically if we perform PCA on the top 500 (in terms of variance) as compared to top 5000 genes?
-> Its not a very drastic change if we perform PCA on top 500 vs top 5000 genes. For top 500 genes PC1 = 41% & PC2 = 37% whereas for top 5000 gene PC1 = 40% and PCA = 31%.

2. If the answer is yes, then would we consider the system (the cell) to be noisy? If the above answer is no, then what can we say about the system as a whole?
-> Since there is not a very big and drastic change we can say that experiment is well controlled and has worked well. 

3. What is the overall takeaway from PCA plots and its correlation with metadata?
-> The samples take at the beginning ie at 0th hours have the lowest variance and the samples taken at the end of a full day have the highest PC1 and lower PC2.

## Remove noise due to experimental conditions

1. Is the batch effect consistent amongst all the donors in the experiment?
-> No the batch effect isn't very consitent.

2. Does overall biology make sense after removing the batch effect? What has changed after batch effect removal?
-> Yes. After removing the batch effect, the clusters are more defined. This tells us how the samples behave at particular time intervals.
